## Planning Part C: Where to find your data


### Option 1: Part A: Internally (at CHHS)

A significant emphasis in our overall data initiative is the collaboration and sharing of data assets between CHHS departments. We want to work toward **refining our process of data sharing** so it is easy and efficient in order to encourage greater interdepartmental collaboration and communication. 
What follows is a summary of each department within CHHS and the data assets they control. This table is a work in progress, and anyone from within a particular department can add  to this table by contacting their (director? Manager?) here. 

### Option 2: Externally (Publicly-Available Data)

In the past decade, public interest in big data and data-driven projects has skyrocketed. As a result, there is a **wealth of data available** for free that may help you contextualize your results, find baseline measurements, or contribute to your findings. This section showcases **some of our favorite sources** of publicly available data.

  * [USAFacts.org](USAFacts.org) — A data-driven portrait of the American population, our government’s finances, and government’s impact on society that uses federal, state, and local data from over 70 sources.
