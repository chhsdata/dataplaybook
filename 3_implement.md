## Play 03. Data Management: accessing and sharing data

This play will provide you **resources to use best practices to access, share, and manage data appropriately.**

### 1. Identify and Gather

 Identify the data you will use. Conduct a **data audit** to prioritize your data.

  * Start looking for data in the [Open Data Portal Catalog](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/) of public datasets available.
  * Then use the **dataset priority scoring tool** to inventory department data for your analysis. 

### 2. CHHS Data De-Identification

Once you have your chosen data sets, review Data De-Identification best practices before working with your data.

The [CHHS Data De-Identification Guidelines](https://chhsdata.github.io/dataplaybook/resource_library#datade-id) are the default policy for CHHS departments.  These guidelines are focused on the assessment of aggregate or summary data for purposes of de-identification and public release. The guidelines address data includes personal characteristics of individuals who have a legal right to privacy. Personal characteristics include but are not limited to age, race, sex, and residence and other identifiers specified in the IPA and HIPAA, found on page 8 of the document. These guidelines focus on the assessment of personal characteristics that are included in various data sets or tables to assess risk for identification of the individuals to which they pertain.

Below is the list of procedures and methods explained in the De-Identification Guidelines:

Highlighted De-Identification Considerations:

  * **De-identification under HIPAA:** For Departments covered by HIPAA, de-identification must meet the HIPAA standard. Use the CHHS Data De-Identification Guidelines to make and document an expert determination consistent with the HIPAA standard.
  * **HIPAA and IPA:** HIPAA requirements apply in combination with IPA requirements. While most state agencies are covered by the California Information Practices Act (IPA), some are also covered by or impacted by HIPAA, the United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Unlike the IPA, which applies to all personal information, HIPAA only applies to certain health or healthcare-related information. 
  * **Customizing guidelines:** If a CHHS Department wants to customize the guidelines, it must have appropriate references to departmental processes and must file a copy of their guidelines with the Office of the Agency Information Office.

The guidelines support CHHS governance goals to reduce inconsistency of practices across Departments, align standards used across Departments, facilitate the release of useful data to the public, promote transparency of state government, and support other CHHS initiatives. 

### 3. CHHS Data Sharing

Review Data Sharing best practices before collaborating on your data project. 
 
[Data sharing at CHHS]({{ site.baseurl }}/resource_library#datasharing "CHHS Data Sharing Framework") is governed by the **CHHS Data Exchange Agreement.** The Master agreement coupled with the Business Use Case Proposal, together form the complete, standardized, legally-compliant data sharing agreement.

  * The [Master agreement](https://chhsdata.github.io/dataplaybook/documents/datasharing/CHHS%20Data%20Sharing%20-%20Legal%20Agreement.pdf) consists of general legal boilerplate language.
  * The [Business Use Case Proposal](https://chhsdata.github.io/dataplaybook/documents/datasharing/CHHS%20Data%20Sharing%20-%20Legal%20Agreement.pdf) is the specific business case to document each data exchange under the master agreement. The Business Use Case Proposal includes information such as data elements, intended use, etc. These are the [instructions](https://chhsdata.github.io/dataplaybook/documents/datasharing/Business%20Use%20Case%20Proposal%20-%20Instructions.pdf) for the proposal. 

>**Tip:** Use this [Process Flow](https://chhsdata.github.io/dataplaybook/documents/datasharing/CHHS%20Data%20Sharing%20-%20Process%20Flow.pdf) to walk through using the Data Exchange Agreement.

The goals of data sharing at CHHS are to:
 
* Establish a legal framework for data initiatives
* Maximize appropriate sharing to increase positive outcomes and customer service
* Ensure privacy and security protections
* Reduce risk and use of duplicative resources
* Standardize data use agreements among CHHS Departments and offices
* Reduce contracting and data use agreement redundancies
* Track activity for better understanding of common data sharing needs between CHHS departments


Data Sharing Tips:
1.	**Cross-departmental collaboration:** The CHHS data sharing process encourages collaboration between departments. Start by requesting a meeting with the data provider to talk through your business use case. You will likely find the data provider has important insights about the data you are requesting.
2.	**Business Use Case Proposal Development: **The CHHS data sharing process requires data providers to work with the Departmental Data Coordinator in the development of a Business Use Case Proposal. Data coordinators will help programs refine Business Use Case Proposals so that they can be successful. If the two parties cannot come to agreement, the data coordinators will assist in taking the request to the Risk Management Subcommittee to help moderate the dispute.
3.	**Intra-agency data sharing: **The CHHS Data Exchange Agreement and associated resources govern intra-agency data sharing between CHHS departments. Considering using these resources as templates for data sharing agreements with California government agencies, local governments, and universities as well.
