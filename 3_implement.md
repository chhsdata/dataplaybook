## Play 03. Implement: plan & strategy

This play will help Departments move from conversation to action. It will provide resources that will allow the Departments to succeed. This might include: roles and responsibilities; governance structures; and data standards.

This play will also include resources on project management and change management to help both staff implement and leadership enforce the importance of this work.

>This Play moves away from the **theoretical** and drives toward the **tactical**.

By detailing all critical steps before starting the project, the Department can anticipate factors  they otherwise would not consider until encountered and identify potential problems and challenges on the front end. 

The planning becomes proactive instead of reactive, which allows best practices to be used and ensures that energy and time are spent on implementing a high-quality, well‐thought‐out project rather than "putting out fires."

The planning and implementation processes will allow any person working on the project, regardless of his or her level of involvement, to fully understand the goal of the project and how it is to be accomplished. It ensures that everyone working on the project is on the same page and that any discrepancies are resolved before they become costly to the project or population served.

>This play will also include various **resources designed** to help with project management and data management.

The **Data Management Resources** will include resources on: data access and publishing; data standards; data documentation; and data tools and analytics.

### Data De-Identification Guidelines
 
CHHS collects, manages, and disseminates a wide range of data. As departments classify data tables and catalog their publishable state data, they should be mindful of legal and policy restrictions on publication of certain kinds of data. The CHHS Data Subcommittee commissioned the development of Agency-wide data de-identification guidelines to assist departments in assessing data for public release. 

The [CHHS Data De-Identification Guidelines](https://github.com/chhsdata/dataplaybook/raw/gh-pages/documents/CHHS-DDG-V1.0-092316.pdf "CHHS Data De-Identification Guidelines") support CHHS governance goals to reduce inconsistency of practices across departments, align standards used across departments, facilitate the release of useful data to the public, promote transparency of state government, and support other CHHS initiatives, such as the [CHHS Open Data Portal](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/ "CHHS Open Data Portal").
