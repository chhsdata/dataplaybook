## Play 03. Implement: plan & strategy

This play will help Departments move from conversation to action. It will provide resources that will allow the Departments to succeed. This might include: roles and responsibilities; governance structures; and data standards.

This play will also include resources on project management and change management to help both staff implement and leadership enforce the importance of this work.

>This Play moves away from the **theoretical** and drives toward the **tactical**.

By detailing all critical steps before starting the project, the Department can anticipate factors  they otherwise would not consider until encountered and identify potential problems and challenges on the front end. 

The planning becomes proactive instead of reactive, which allows best practices to be used and ensures that energy and time are spent on implementing a high-quality, well‐thought‐out project rather than "putting out fires."

The planning and implementation processes will allow any person working on the project, regardless of his or her level of involvement, to fully understand the goal of the project and how it is to be accomplished. It ensures that everyone working on the project is on the same page and that any discrepancies are resolved before they become costly to the project or population served.

>This play will also include various **resources designed** to help with project management and data management.

>Departments will work to identify Data Sharing and Data De-Identification best practices and lessons learned. 

The **Project Management Resources** will include resources on: agile planning and development; resource management; training; communication; and governance.  

The **Data Management Resources** will include resources on: data access and publishing; data standards; data documentation; and data tools and analytics.

### CHHS Data De-Identification
 
CHHS collects, manages and disseminates a wide range of data.  As departments classify data tables and catalog their publishable state data, they should be mindful of legal and policy restrictions on publication of certain kinds of data. The CHHS Data Subcommittee commissioned the development of Agency-wide guidelines to assist departments in assessing data for public release. 

The [CHHS Data De-Identification Guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/resource_library/#datade-id "CHHS Data De-Identification Guidelines") support CHHS governance goals to reduce inconsistency of practices across departments, align standards used across departments, facilitate the release of useful data to the public, promote transparency of state government, and support other CHHS initiatives, such as the [CHHS Open Data Portal](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/ "CHHS Open Data Portal"){:target="_blank"}. 

See the full guidelines [in the Resource Library]({{ site.baseurl }}/resource_library/#datade-id "CHHS Data De-Identification Guidelines").

### CHHS Data Sharing
 
[Data sharing at CHHS]({{ site.baseurl }}/resource_library/#datasharing "CHHS Data Sharing Framework") is governed by the CHHS Data Exchange Agreement and the associated business use case proposal process. The CHHS Data Exchange Agreement is bifurcated into two parts—one master agreement with general legal boilerplate language and subordinate "Business Use Case Proposals" containing the specific business case to document each data exchange under the master agreement. The Business Use Case Proposal includes information such as data type, intended use, etc. The master agreement, when coupled with the Business Use Case Proposal, forms the complete, standardized, legally-compliant data sharing agreement.

The goals of data sharing at CHHS are to:
 
* Establish a legal framework for data initiatives
* Maximize appropriate sharing to increase positive outcomes and customer service
* Ensure privacy and security protections
* Reduce risk and use of duplicative resources
* Standardize data use agreements among CHHS departments and offices
* Reduce contracting and data use agreement redundancies

See the CHHS Data Exchange Agreement, Business Use Case Proposal, and related data sharing materials [in the Resource Library]({{ site.baseurl }}/resource_library/#datasharing "CHHS Data Sharing Framework").
