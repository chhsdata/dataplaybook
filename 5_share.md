## Play 05. Share your Data Story

The focus of this play is to share your progress and data stories to build the data-community at CHHS. It is important to recognize that we will have successes and failures and it is equally important to communicate our failures as much as our successes in order for us to learn from both. We don’t need to reinvent the wheel, so we share use cases or examples to create a feedback loop that strengthens our collective data capacity. 

Here are a few recommended ways to share your data story to share progress with your team, department, and agency and to share your data-driven success with the data-community at CHHS. 

1. **Meetings and Showcases** – Don’t underestimate the power of leveraging the people network. Organize a “data showcase” for your team, or participate in one of emerging across the Agency. Use these events to build a shared understanding of data, celebrate successes, and learn from your peers.

2. **Data Publication and Presentation** – Your Department or program may have an established visual and brand style that can provide greater credibility to your data analysis. Aspects such as color, font face, and citation format can add consistency. See data visualization resources in Play 4 and Select Technical Resources to create visuals that align with your Department’s brand. 

3. **Share your success stories in the data-community page** - [CHHS Data-Driven Success Stories](https://chhsdata.github.io/dataplaybook/success_stories/) demonstrate how we leverage data and technology to improve services to Californians and become more client centric. The stories aim to create awareness of innovative ideas and improve interdepartmental coordination by providing a platform to collaborate, share ideas, and expand CHHS’s data culture.
