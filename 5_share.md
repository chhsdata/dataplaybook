#Play 05. Share: progress & results

It will be important to recognize that we will have successes and failures and it will be equally important to communicate our failures as much as our successes in order for us to learn from those failures. 

This play will include a standardized template of how we can catalog our various projects so that we can create a **“Storyboard”** giving us the ability to recognize work across the Agency while also creating a catalog of various activities. 

>**How do we share lessons learned and create a feedback loop?**.

**Documentation** – The completion of an “Information Architecture Assessment” provides standard documentation about the characteristics, linkages, and dependencies of all the relevant data for each use case.

There’s an opportunity to use this documentation to build a repository of Agency data assets that captures the Agency’s “Information Architecture” for the most critical and valuable Agency data assets.
