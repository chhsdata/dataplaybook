## <a name="goals"></a> Step 1: Identify your Guiding Questions and Set your Goals

It is important to decide your **vision** and **purpose** behind your project, and identify what you hope your data project will accomplish. Be thoughtful — what impact do you hope to have? What changes are you trying to bring about? It is worth taking the time to write down your answers to the broader **Guiding Questions**, as they will be the foundation of your goals and strategic plan.   

First, a bit about goals: for your project to execute smoothly, it is best to choose  SMART Goals, of goals that are **specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely**. Look at our summary of the [SMART Goal checklist](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm) below:

![SMART Goal Framework]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/01_figure05.png "SMART Goal Framework")

| **Hint:** Goals often fall into one of the following categories: |
|---------|
| - **Increase** something (e.g. increase healthy behaviors in a population) |
| - **Make** something  (e.g. produce a mapping/visualization of all COVID-19 cases across California) |
| - **Improve** something (e.g. improve living conditions of a population) |
| - **Reduce** something (e.g. reduce number of smokers in California) |

## <a name="strategicplan"></a> Step 2: Develop a Strategic Plan

Now that you have identified your goals, you must develop a strategy for achieving your desired outcomes. A Strategic Plan is first and foremost a **Roadmap to Success** – the more care and thought you put into your plan, the more likely you are to produce a successful data project.

| Did you know? |
|--------|
| CHHS has its own [Strategic Plan](https://chhsdata.github.io/dataplaybook/documents/CHHS%20Information%20Strategic%20Plan%202016.pdf) that summarizes our vision and goals for every department’s products and services. While not a substitute for your strategic plan, it can give you ideas and and helps you ensure your strategy aligns with CHHS’ guiding principles and mission statement. |

Utilize a **strategic planning framework** such as the use case diagram or a logic model. These frameworks will help you explicitly define each step necessary to achieve your goals as well as anticipate what challenges you may face throughout your project.

>### **Strategy Tip:** Find the *action words* that best describe the work you’ll do:
>
>Action words are verbs that describe how you will approach each task in this project. They don’t describe your intended outcome (i.e. increase and reduce are not action words); rather, they describe roles you will take throughout your project to assure a successful outcome. 
>
>If you are creating a product:
>  * Update, Upgrade, Develop, Create, Implement, Evaluate, Produce
>If you are managing a project:
>  * Oversee, coordinate, supervise, manage, plan, support, transition
>If you  are implementing the specifics of a project:
>  * Write, process, provide, maintain, reconcile, direct, administer

## <a name="usecase"></a> The Use Case Diagram

This framework is most helpful for projects where you intend to **build some sort of system** (e.g. website, smart phone app, etc.) that your users must interact with. You also must use a **Business Use Case** for any data you request using the Data Sharing Agreement form. 

>#### A Use Case Diagram will…
>  * **Identify** the goals of system-user interactions
>  * Define and organize **functional requirements** in your system
>  * Specify the **context** and **requirements** of a system
>  * **Model** the basic flow of events in a use case

### Instructions for building a Use Case Diagram:

| **Step 1:** Start by defining your actors, or the users that interact with your system. they can be anything from a person to an organization or outside system that interacts with your product. <br> **Note**: Think broadly -- your users may include institutions both within and outside of CHHS as well as specific populations of the public |
| **Step 2:** For each user, list all the ways they can interact with your system (these are the “use cases”) <br> **Note**: Ensure you consider alternate/undesirable courses of events and use cases that aren’t obvious |
| **Step 3:** Draw lines between use cases to reflect commonalities or relationships among them. <br> **Note**: Identify the use case with the greatest number of relationships/associations -- the most common use cases represent the functions in your project that should be essential. |

## <a name="logicmodel"></a> The Logic Model

The logic model framework focuses on **visualizing the relationship** between **inputs**, **outcomes**, and **costs** associated with your project. It is a **graphical model** where each component (or “phase”) of your project relates to a list of intended effects in **an implicit, ‘if-then’ way**. 

![Flow of Logic Model]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/01_figure07.png "Flow of Logic Model")
Flow of Logic Model

### The seven "components" you’ll consider are:
| 1. Inputs: The resources you need for your project <br>2. Activities: What the staff or the program does with those resources<br>3. Outputs: Tangible products, capacities, or deliverables that result from the activities<br>4. Outcomes: Changes that occur in other people or conditions because of the activities and outputs<br>5. Impacts: The most distal/long-term outcomes<br>6. Assumptions: Your beliefs about the program and the resources involved (including how successful you you think it will be or the challenges you may face)<br>7. Moderators: Contextual factors that are out of control of the program but may help or hinder your efforts. These may influence participation, implementation, achievement of your outcomes. |

> **Example:** 
>e.g. **If** I hire more staff for my project (input), **then** I can collect more data about who would benefit from my service (activity). **If** we have more data, **then** our predictive model will be more accurate (output). **If** our model is more accurate, **then** we can increase outreach to populations who are more likely to benefit from our service (outcome) and so on. 

To begin, simply **create six headers** as is shown in the diagram above — this can be done by hand, with sticky notes, or online. 

### Guiding Questions:
1. Identifying Impact: What measurable change are you seeking to achieve in the long-term?
2. Identifying Outcomes: What measurable changes are you seeking to achieve in the short-term? 
3. Identifying Outputs: What tangible outcomes can you measure immediately following the implementation of your product/project?
4. Identifying Activities: What are some high-level steps you must take to complete your project?

List everything that comes to mind when you answer the those **guiding questions** above, drawing a box around each entry. Finally, draw arrows between boxes to signify the ‘if-then’ relationship.
