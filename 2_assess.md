  ## Questions
  * What data do you currently collect?
  * How do **programs or stakeholders** use data currently? What do they do with it? How do they use it to make decisions or produce products for external stakeholders?
  * What are **limits** to either the data or the implementation solution?
  * What are the **risks/issues** with the current data? What value is not being realized?
  * Identify the current workflow for **collecting, processing, and publishing** data. Are there dependencies to collecting, processing, and publishing the data?

  ## Resources
  When looking for data, start with the [Open Data Portal Catalog](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/dataset-catalog/resource/2d60ad30-db63-43c8-a4b6-0861f27856ff){:target="_blank"} of public datasets available. You can use the [dataset priority scoring tool](https://github.com/chhsdata/opendatahandbook/raw/gh-pages/documents/CHHS-Open-Data-Priority-Scoring-Template.xlsx) to inventory department data for your analysis.
