#Play 02. Assess: tools & capabilities

This play will include a numeric score card that will assess a Department's current assets and capabilities—including technology and human resources–to leverage their data to help formulate program or policy solutions.

* What data do you currently collect?
* What technology can you leverage?
* What data analytics tools do you have available within the Department or Agency?
* What established processes can you leverage?

The goal is to look at existing capabilities to address the problems or issues outlined.

The capability assessment will help facilitate a conversation within the Department  to help catalog the various resources available in order to address the problems identified in the objective assessment.

>Assess the Department's readiness by **identifying the gaps and needs** in order to operationalize the data strategy.

1. How do **programs or stakeholders** use data currently? What do they do with it? How do they use it to make decisions or produce products for external stakeholders?
2. What are **limits** to either the data or the implementation solution?
3. What are the **risks/issues** with the current data? What value is not being realized?
4. Identify the current workflow for **collecting, processing, and publishing** data. Are there dependencies to collecting, processing, and publishing the data?

>To give an even deeper look at these strategies, Departments share how they’ve put them to use in different scenarios and for different efforts.
