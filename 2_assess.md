## Play 02. Assess: tools & capabilities

This play focuses on assessing a Department’s current assets and capabilities—including technology and human resources–to leverage their data to help formulate program or policy solutions. The goal is to **address the gaps in current assets and capabilities.**
  
  ### 1. Assess Current Assets and Capacities

Catalog the various resources available in order to address any gaps identified.

  * What data do you currently collect?
  * What technology can you leverage?
  * What data analytics tools do you have available within the Department or Agency?
    * See [select technical resources](https://chhsdata.github.io/dataplaybook/resource_library/#technicalresources)
  * What established processes can you leverage?
  * What are the training needs?
    * Identify staff development and training opportunities. [See the Select Training Resources](https://chhsdata.github.io/dataplaybook/resource_library/#trainingresources).

 ### 2. Assess Readiness

  * How do **programs or stakeholders** use data currently? What do they do with it? How do they use it to make decisions or produce products for external stakeholders?
  * What are **limits** to either the data or the implementation solution?
  * What are the **risks and issues** with the current data? What value is not being realized?
  * Identify the current workflow for **collecting, processing, and publishing** data. Are there dependencies to collecting, processing, and publishing the data?

 ### 3. Analytics Assessment

Consider using one of these existing data capacity frameworks to continue assessing analytic capacity, developing analytic strategy, and building analytic capacity.

  * [Strategic Use of Data Rubric](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/strategic-use-data-rubric/) – A resource that provides direction and support to education organizations to transform their use of data. The rubric establishes a common language and framework to more clearly illustrate what effective data use at the system-level looks like.
    * The California Department of Public Health has adapted the data rubric to their needs. [Download the Public Health data rubric here](https://github.com/chhsdata/dataplaybook/raw/gh-pages/documents/Public-Health-Strategic-Use-of-Data-Rubric-09-04-18.docx).

  * [Analytics Capability Roadmap for Human Service Agencies]({{ site.baseurl }}/documents/APHSA-Analytic-Capability-Roadmap-1-0-for-Human-Services-Agencies.pdf) – Helps assess current analytic capability and developing an analytic strategy to help meet their organizational objectives and measure outcomes across programs.

  * [Roadmap to Capacity Building in Analytics]({{ site.baseurl }}/documents/APHSA-Roadmap-to-Capacity-Building-in-Analytics-White-Paper.pdf) – Provides information on (1) analytical capabilities required for successful analytical efforts, (2) skillsets as well as governance structures and change management processes for such efforts, and (3) practical examples of existing solutions across public and private health and human service sectors.
