## Five plays for your department

Here are five plays designed to help Departments utilize data to inform program and policy development. These plays can also be used to navigate CHHS Governance processes. Each section features detailed best practices. 

A play contains data strategies, approaches and actions a Department may use to  administer programs and address policy issues.

1. Define: goals & objectives
2. Assess: tools & capabilities
3. Implement: plan & strategy
4. Evaluate: outcomes & impacts
5. Share: progress & results

## Data changes everything

>Our goal is to leverage our internal data to **improve the programs and services** we deliver to our clients.

The Playbook can be used by Departments to solve problems with data. It is designed to help build an organizational culture that is focused on data and data-driven decision making. Departments can leverage the various components of the Playbook as they see fit and can customize the Playbook to their needs. 

The Playbook serves as a hub for data-related resources available to all Departments. It is designed to be a **“living document”** that will change and adapt based on our collective experiences. Departments are encouraged to contribute to our library of  resources.

The Playbook is a mechanism for us to disseminate best practices and lessons learned across the Agency. It consists of numerous toolkits that will help Department staff navigate data projects and allow us to discuss data-related issues and projects with common terminology.

>Organizations are often data-rich but insight-poor.

The primary objective is to help Departments increase their efficiency and effectiveness–we do not want to just move data across Departments, rather we want to leverage data to improve outcomes for our clients and the effectiveness of our programs.

## Playbook users

>Use the Playbook throughout the data management lifecycle

The Playbook is designed with the analyst as the primary user. It will serve as a resource and a guide to help build the necessary skillsets within the existing workforce to not only think differently about data, but to proactively utilize data to improve the programs and services delivered. 

These plays are designed to provide a high-level overview for Departmental leadership, managers and supervisors.  

The plays are intended for program and data analysts; budget analysts; procurement analysts; and policy and legislative analysts. 

The Departments can help us identify additional users who may benefit from the Playbook. As we build a culture of data, we hope to not only focus on existing data consumers, but expand how staff across Agency utilize data in their day-to-day work.

## When to use the Playbook

The Playbook may be used in different scenarios and for different purposes by different users.

For example, the Playbook may be utilized as Departments are developing IT-related projects. This can be a tool to help Departments navigate the Agency Information Governance review and approval processes. 

The Playbook may be leveraged by program and budget staff in the development of Budget Change Concepts (BCCs) and Budget Change Proposals (BCPs). 

The Playbook may be used  by program and legislative affairs staff in the development of Legislative Proposals  and/or Enrolled Bill Reports (EBRs).
