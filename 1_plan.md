## Planning: What data do I need?

When starting your project, it may be tempting to rush into data 
collection or data analysis without a purposeful plan and strategy. Before doing so, *there are some key questions about your data and your project you must address.*

This section will: 
  * Help you identify the right questions to guide your data collection process
  * Provides several frameworks to generate the concrete goals and strategies you have for your data
  *Offer an overview of different types of data you may need when entering your data collection phase 

## Step 1: Set **specific goals & objectives** for your project

Before jumping into data collection, be sure you take the time to identify what you hope your data project will accomplish.

>Examples: What impact will your project have? What measurable change do you hope 
to bring about? 

### Use the  SMART Goal Checklist:

![SMART Goal Framework]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/01_figure05.png "SMART Goal Framework")

> Note that **your SMART goals will typically fall into one of the following categories:**
>  * Increase something (e.g. increase healthy behaviors in a population)
>  * Make something  (e.g. produce a mapping/visualization of all COVID-19 cases across California)
>  * Improve something (e.g. improve living conditions of a population)
>  * Reduce something (e.g. reduce number of smokers in California)

### Identify some *action words* that describe your strategy:

Action words are distinct from the goal words above -- they do not describe your intended outcome (i.e. increase and reduce are *not action words*). Rather, they address **how** you will accomplish your goals and the roles you will take throughout your project. 

#### Examples:
If you are creating a product:
  * Update, Upgrade, Develop, Create, Implement, Evaluate, Produce
If you are managing a project:
  * Oversee, coordinate, supervise, manage, plan, support, transition
If you  are implementing the specifics of a project:
  * Write, process, provide, maintain, reconcile, direct, administer

## Step 2: Develop a Strategic Plan

Consider building a **use case diagram** or a **logic model** to better plan your strategy. Utilizing one of these two frameworks will allow you to consider how your project will contribute to your department’s or CHHS’ larger goals and give you ideas as to how you can track your progress over time. 

### The Use Case Diagram

This framework is most helpful for projects where you intend the user to *interact with a system you built*. Specifically, they can assist with the following:

  * Representing the goals of system-user interactions
  * Defining and organizing functional requirements in your system
  * Specifying the context and requirements of a system
  * Modeling the basic flow of events in a use case
*Note: An example diagram is included on the following page*

#### To build your use case diagram:

**Step 1:** Start by defining your actors, or the users that interact with your system. they can be anything from a person to an organization or outside system that interacts with your product. 
  *Think broadly -- your users may include institutions both within and outside of CHHS as well as specific populations of the public*

**Step 2:** For each user, list all the ways they can interact with your system (these are the “use cases”)
  *Consider alternate/undesirable courses of events and use cases that aren’t obvious*

**Step 3:** Draw lines between use cases to reflect commonalities or relationships among them 
  *Hint: Identify the use case with the greatest number of relationships/associations -- the most common use cases represent the functions in your project that should be essential.*

### The Logic Model

This framework focuses on visualizing impact, outcomes, and costs associated with your project. Specifically, this framework will help you if you’re struggling to answer the following questions:
1. **Identifying Impact:** What measurable change are you seeking to achieve in the long-term?
2. **Identifying Outcomes:** What measurable changes are you seeking to achieve in the short-term? 
3. **Identifying Outputs:** What tangible outcomes can you measure immediately following the implementation of your product/project?
4. **Identifying Inputs:** What resources (money, staff, technology) do you need to invest in the program for it to be successful?
