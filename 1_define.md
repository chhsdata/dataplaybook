## Play 01. Define: goals & objectives

This play is focused on **Defining** what is the problem you are trying to solve. This Play provides frameworks to help **develop a use case**; **define the customer or stakeholder** who would benefit from implementing the use case; and **assess the impact after implementation**.

### How do you build a use case? 
*Build a use case around a particular opportunity, issue or problem. This is Stage 1 Business Analysis.*

 ### 1. BEGIN BY answering these questions:
1. What problem are we trying to solve? 
2. What outcomes do we want to achieve?
3. **How will data work to meet our mission?**
4. What kinds of data do we need access to?
5. Who are the main stakeholders and how do we engage them?
6. How are we going to track, assess and monitor progress?
7. Can we pilot a few projects and start small? What can we learn   from starting small and building out?
8. Do we have the right workforce in place?
9. Have we received buy-in from leadership and across teams?
10. Are we delivering on the needs of our customers? How do we know?


### 2. Use this framework to articulate your basic use case

As a **[user role]** I want to do **[scope]** in order to achieve **[measurable objective]** to serve **[stakeholder group]**.

>**Tip**
>Start small and set clear, measurable objectives.
>Be sure you are thinking critically about what your success metrics will be. You must have clear and actionable goals that you want to achieve with your data project.

### 3. Use this framework to build out your use case, with answers to the questions above.

### 4. Logic Model
Consider [creating a Logic Model](https://www.practicalplaybook.org/resources/develop-logic-model) to demonstrate how a program achieves an intended outcome or impact and where data-driven interventions can further program goals.

### Conclusion
There are dozens of ways each Department can use data, and the applications can seem endless. It will be important to pick one core mission problem, and then gradually build and grow programs based on lessons learned.
