## Play 01. Define: goals & objectives

First, facilitate a high-level conversation on some of the most pressing issues facing the Department and what data solutions might be available to address the issue or problem. 
Continue to refine the value proposition and expand it after assessing data assets.

There are dozens of ways each Department can use data, and the applications can seem endless. It will be important to pick one core mission problem, and then gradually build and grow programs based on lessons learned.

4. What kinds of data do we need access to?
5. Who are the main stakeholders and how do we engage them?
6. How are we going to track, assess and monitor progress?
7. Can we pilot a few projects and start small? What can we learn   from starting small and building out?
8. Do we have the right workforce in place?
9. Have we received buy-in from leadership and across teams?
10. Are we delivering on the needs of our customers? How do we know?


## What is the problem you are trying to solve?

Develop a use case; define the customer/stakeholder who would benefit from implementing the use case; and assess the impact after the implementation.

As a **[user role]** I want to do **[scope]** in order to achieve **[measurable objective]** to serve **[stakeholder group]**.

## Resources
Consider [creating a Logic Model](https://www.practicalplaybook.org/resources/develop-logic-model) to demonstrate how a program achieves an intended outcome or impact and where data-driven interventions can further program goals.
