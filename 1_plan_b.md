## Planning Part B: What Data to Collect

With your goals and strategy successfully outlined, you can now think about **what data or measurements** you need to answer your guiding questions. If you’re a manager, you’ll also need to **define your outcome measures** and **performance/self-assessment metrics** to maintain the integrity of your project and ensure you’re supporting your team and stakeholders as best you can. 

### Measurement Data

Your measurement data is the core data that informs the outcome of your project. If it’s not clear to you what data you need to measure, try **thinking about your purpose** in initiating/participating in this project. What is the need of your consumers/users that you are trying  to meet? What will this data tell you about how things should should change?

>**Example Purpose Statements:**
>  * I need to decide **how to allocate** resources to different programs based on which is the most successful
>  * I want to **improve or refine** an existing program or model to be more effective
>  * I want to **create** product or service that positively impacts a community
>  * I want to **look at existing data** to find trends and patterns that people care about

### For Managers: Outcome Data

This is the data you need to collect **after deploying your product or service** to determine whether or not it met your goals and was successful.
  * [Key Performance Indicators](kpilibrary.com/) (KPIs) are also a great framework for measuring performance relative to your goals. 
  * Check out [this resource](https://kpi.org/KPI-Basics) to learn what they are, why they work, and how to set effective KPIs

### For Managers: Readiness & Self-Assessment Data

You also must ensure you **have the resources necessary** to implement your goals  and strategies effectively. Resources can include:
  * The data you need to collect
  * The data analysis tools available to you
  * Your department’s data governance
  * The human resources/staff available and their training needs

Remember, if you do not have the resources you need, **address it promptly**. Be on the lookout for areas of weakness or points you can improve throughout your project. This  next  section will review the **key gaps and weaknesses** that often cause problems and how to address them.

>**Here are some questions you should ask yourself when determining if you’re ready to begin your project:**
>  * Do my managers/directors have the bandwidth to support me?
>  * Do I/my team have enough expertise to complete this project?
>  * Does my department have a dedicated **Data Steward?**  *(Note: Data Stewards keep track of data in their department, maintain the quality of this data, monitor data usage, and ensure the security of the data).*
>  * Do I have access to the data I need to complete the project?

Like with your strategic planning process, it may be helpful to consult some frameworks and checklists for assessing readiness. 

Harvard’s [Strategic Use of Data Self-Assessment Guide](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/files/cepr-sdp/files/sdp-rubric-self-asssessment.pdf) offers a useful template. This model is thorough and covers every aspect of your project you will need to assess. If you’re looking for even more guidance, you can check out the [Analytics Capability Assessment for Human Service Agencies](https://chhsdata.github.io/dataplaybook/documents/APHSA-Analytic-Capability-Roadmap-1-0-for-Human-Services-Agencies.pdf).

**Note**: If you’re working with a Health/Human Service-related project and you want a more *concrete, detailed* list of **everything to assess when determining readiness**, look no further than this [Roadmap to Capacity Building in Analytics](https://chhsdata.github.io/dataplaybook/documents/APHSA-Roadmap-to-Capacity-Building-in-Analytics-White-Paper.pdf). This document is dense, gives great insight into what you need to carry out a successful product, including:
1. All the skill sets you’ll need on your team 
2. Necessary data governance procedures and practices and 
3. The methods of data processing you should know
